# # Convert encrypted 3D components
#
# The 2023R1 release of Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT) implemented a new [solid modeling kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_modeling_kernel).
#
# This example demonstrates how to easily migrate encrypted
# 3D components from older versions of AEDT
# that relied on the ACIS modeling kernel, to the new
# versions of AEDT that employ
# the Parasolid kernel. Specifically, if your 
# encrypted 3D
# components were created with version 22R2 or 
# earlier, you'll need to convert them
# to a version â‰¥ 23R1 that supports the Parasolid modeler.
#
# Keywords: **HFSS**, **Encrypted**, **3D component**, **Modeler kernel**.

# ## Prerequisites
#
# ### Perform imports

# +
import os
import tempfile
import time

from ansys.aedt.core import Desktop, Hfss, settings
from ansys.aedt.core.examples.downloads import download_file
# -

# ### Define constants
# Constants help ensure consistency and avoid repetition throughout the example.

AEDT_VERSION = "2025.1"
OLD_AEDT_VERSION = "2024.1"
NG_MODE = False  # Open AEDT UI when AEDT is launched.

# ### Create temporary directory
#
# Create a temporary working directory.
# The name of the working folder is stored in ``temp_folder.name``.
#
# > **Note:** The final cell in the notebook cleans up the temporary folder. If you want to
# > retrieve the AEDT project and data, do so before executing the final cell in the notebook.

temp_folder = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(suffix=".ansys")

# ## Covert the encrypted component
#
# ### Retrieve the component that will be converted
#
# The ``download_file()`` method provides access to a library
# of examples and models from the Ansys GitHub organization: 
# [example-data repository](https://github.com/ansys/example-data/tree/master/pyaedt). Download the "old"
# encrypted 3D component and define a name to use for the new, coverted component.

# +
a3dcomp = download_file(
    source="component_3d",
    name="SMA_Edge_Connector_23r2_encrypted_password_ansys.a3dcomp",
    local_path=temp_folder.name,
)

# Name of the converted 3D component:
new_component_filename = os.path.join(temp_folder.name, r"SMA_Edge_Connector_encrypted.a3dcomp")
# -

# ### Enable multiple desktop instances.
#
# This example runs two versions of AEDT simultaneously.
#
# > **Note:** Both the old and new versions of AEDT must be installed on the machine
# > where this example runs.

settings.use_multi_desktop = True

# ### Load the encrypted 3D component.
#
# Launch the old version of AEDT and load the encrypted component.
# Pass the keyword argument ``aedt_process_id`` to ensure that the ``Hfss``
# instance connects to the correct running version of HFSS. The encryption
# password must be provided to enable conversion.

# +
aedt_old = Desktop(new_desktop=True, version=OLD_AEDT_VERSION)

# Insert an empty HFSS design.
hfss1 = Hfss(aedt_process_id=aedt_old.aedt_process_id, solution_type="Terminal")

# Insert the encrypted 3D component.
cmp = hfss1.modeler.insert_3d_component(input_file=a3dcomp, password="ansys")

# Open the 3D component definition.
app_comp = cmp.edit_definition(password="ansys")
# -

# ### Convert the encrypted 3D component
#
# Launch another instance of AEDT to enable conversion of the
# 3D component.
#
# After the new version of AEDT is started, the process ID 
# is retrieved via the property ``aedt.aedt_process_id`` and is passed
# as an argument to `Hfss()`. This ensures that the newly created
# `hfss2` object
# is connected to the
# correct version and instance of AEDT.

# +
aedt = Desktop(new_desktop=True, version=AEDT_VERSION)

# Insert an empty HFSS design.
hfss2 = Hfss(aedt_process_id=aedt.aedt_process_id, solution_type="Terminal")

# Copy objects from the old design.
hfss2.copy_solid_bodies_from(design=app_comp, no_vacuum=False, no_pec=False)

# Create the new encrypted 3D component.
hfss2.modeler.create_3dcomponent(
    input_file=new_component_filename,
    is_encrypted=True,
    edit_password="ansys",
    hide_contents=False,
    allow_edit=True,
    password_type="InternalPassword",
)
# -

# ## Finish
#
# ### Save the projects

aedt.save_project()
aedt_old.save_project()
aedt.release_desktop()
aedt_old.release_desktop()
print(f"The new encrypted 3D component can be retrieved from: {new_component_filename}")
# Wait 3 seconds to allow AEDT to shut down before cleaning the temporary directory.
time.sleep(3)

# ### Clean up
#
# All project files are saved in the folder ``temp_folder.name``.
# If you've run this example as a Jupyter notebook, you
# can retrieve those project files. The following cell
# removes all temporary files, including the project folder.

temp_folder.cleanup()
