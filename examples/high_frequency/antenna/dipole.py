# # Dipole antenna
#
# This example demonstrates how to create and analyze a half-wave dipole
# antenna in HFSS.
#
# Keywords: **HFSS**, **antenna**, **3D component**, **far field**.

# ## Prerequisites
#
# ### Perform imports
#
# Import the packages required to run this example.

# +
import os
import tempfile
import time

from ansys.aedt.core import Hfss
# -

# ### Define constants
# Constants help ensure consistency and avoid repetition throughout the example.

AEDT_VERSION = "2025.1"
NUM_CORES = 4
NG_MODE = False  # Open AEDT UI when it is launched.

# ### Create temporary directory
#
# Create a temporary working directory.
# The name of the working folder is stored in ``temp_folder.name``.
#
# > **Note:** The final cell in this notebook cleans up the temporary folder. If you want to
# > retrieve the AEDT project and data, do so before executing the final cell in the notebook.

temp_folder = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(suffix=".ansys")

# ### Launch HFSS
#
# Create an instance of
# the ``Hfss`` class. The Ansys Electronics Desktop will be launched
# with an active HFSS design. The ``hfss`` object is subsequently
# used to
# create and simulate the dipole antenna.

project_name = os.path.join(temp_folder.name, "dipole.aedt")
hfss = Hfss(version=AEDT_VERSION,
            non_graphical=NG_MODE,
            project=project_name,
            new_desktop=True,
            solution_type="Modal",
            )

# ## Model Preparation
#
# ### Define the dipole length as a parameter
#
# The dipole length can be modified by changing the
# parameter ``l_dipole`` to tune the resonance frequency.

hfss["l_dipole"] = "10.2cm"
component_name = "Dipole_Antenna_DM"
freq_range = ["1GHz", "2GHz"]      # Frequency range for analysis and post-processing.
center_freq = "1.5GHz"             # Center frequency
freq_step = "0.5GHz"


# ### Insert the dipole antenna model
#
# The 3D component "Dipole_Antenna_DM" will be inserted from
# the built-in ``syslib`` folder. The full path to the 3D components
# can be retrieved from ``hfss.components3d``.
#
# The component is inserted using the method
# ``hfss.modeler.insert_3d_component()``.
#
#   - The first argument passed to ``insert_3d_component()``
#     is the full path and name of the
#       ``*.a3dcomp`` file.
#   - The second argument is a ``dict`` whose keys are the names of the parameters
#     accessible in the 3D component. In this case, we assign the
#     dipole length, ``"l_dipole"`` to the 3D Component
#     parameter ``dipole_length`` and leave other parameters unchanged.

component_fn = hfss.components3d[component_name]          # Full file name.
comp_params = hfss.get_component_variables(component_name)  # Retrieve dipole parameters.
comp_params["dipole_length"] = "l_dipole"                 # Update the dipole length.
hfss.modeler.insert_3d_component(component_fn, geometry_parameters=comp_params)

# ### Create the 3D domain region
#
# An open region object places a an airbox around the dipole antenna
# and assigns a radiation boundary to the outer surfaces of the region.

hfss.create_open_region(frequency=center_freq)

# ### Specify the solution setup
#
# The solution setup defines parameters that govern the HFSS solution process. This example demonstrates
# how to adapt the solution mesh simultaneously at two frequencies.
# - ``"MaximumPasses"`` specifies the maximum number of passes used for automatic
#   adaptive mesh refinement. In this example the solution runs very fast since only two passes
#   are used. Accuracy can be improved by increasing this value.
# - ``"MultipleAdaptiveFreqsSetup"`` specifies the solution frequencies used during adaptive
#   mesh refinement. Selection of two frequencies, one above and one below the
#   expected resonance frequency help improve mesh quality at the resonant frequency.
#
# > **Note:** The parameter names used here are passed directly to the native AEDT API and therfore
# > do not adhere to [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
#
# Both a discrete frequency sweep and an interpolating sweep are added to the solution setup.
# The discrete sweep provides access to field solution data for post-processing.
# The interpolating sweep builds the
# rational polynomial fit for the network (scattering) parameters over the
# frequency interval defined by ``RangeStart`` and
# ``RangeEnd``.  The solutions from the discrete sweep are used as the starting
# solutions for the interpolating sweep.

# ### Run simulation
#
# The following cell runs the analysis in HFSS including adaptive mesh refinement and
# solution of both frequency sweeps.

# Plot the return loss in Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT). A plot similar to the one shown here will be
# generated in the HFSS design.

# Parameters passed to ``hfss.post.create_report()`` specify which quantities will be
# displayed in the HFSS design.

# ### Create a far-field report
#
# The ``hfss.post.reports_by_category`` helps simplify the syntax required to access
# post-processing capabilities. In this case, results are shown for the current
# variation. The concept of
# "variations" is essential for managing parametric solutions
# in HFSS.
#
# The argument ``sphere_name`` specifies the far-field sphere used to generate the plot.
# In this case, the far-field sphere "3D" was automatically created when HFSS was launched by
# instantiating the ``Hfss`` class.
