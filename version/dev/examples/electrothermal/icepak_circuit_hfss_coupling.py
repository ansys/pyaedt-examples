# # Circuit-HFSS-Icepak coupling workflow
#
# This example shows how to create a two-way coupling
# between HFSS and Icepak.
#
# Consider a design where some components are simulated in
# HFSS with a full 3D model, while others are simulated in Circuit as lumped elements.
# The electrical simulation is done by placing the HFSS design into a Circuit design as
# a subcomponent and connecting the lumped components to its ports.
#
# The purpose of the workflow is to perform a thermal simulation
# of the Circuit-HFSS design, creating a two-way coupling with Icepak
# that allows running multiple iterations. The losses from both designs
# are accounted for.
# - EM losses are evaluated by the HFSS solver and fed into Icepak via a direct link.
# - Losses from the lumped components in the Circuit design are evaluated
# analytically and must be manually set into the Icepak boundary.
#
# On the back of the coupling, temperature information
# is handled differently for HFSS and Circuit.
#
# - For HFSS, a temperature map is exported from the Icepak design and used to create a
# 3D dataset. Then, the material properties in the HFSS design are updated based on this
# dataset.
# - For Circuit, the average temperature of the lumped components is extracted from the
# Icepak design and used to update the temperature-dependent characteristics of the
# lumped components in Circuit.
#
# The Circuit design in this example contains only a
# resistor component, with temperature-dependent resistance
# described by this formula: ``0.162*(1+0.004*(TempE-TempE0))``,
# where TempE is the current temperature and TempE0 is the
# ambient temperature. The HFSS design includes only a cylinder
# with temperature-dependent material conductivity, defined by
# a 2D dataset. The resistor and the cylinder have
# matching resistances.
